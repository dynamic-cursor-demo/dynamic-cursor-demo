		<textContent>This interface uses a cursor that dynamically resizes itself based on the locations of potential targets. This technique is called a “bubble cursor” and was pioneered by Grossman and Balakrishnan (2005). The rationale for this approach is derived from increased efficiency as a result of economy of movement.</textContent>
